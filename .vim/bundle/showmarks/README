ShowMarks provides a visual representation of the location marks.
Marks are useful for jumping back and forth between interesting points in a buffer, but can be hard to keep track of without any way to see where you have placed them.  ShowMarks hopefully makes life easier by placing a sign in the leftmost column of the buffer.  The sign indicates the label of the mark and its location.
It can be toggled on and off and individual marks can be hidden(effectively removing them).

By default the following keymappings are defined:
   \mt : Toggles ShowMarks on and off.
   \mh : Hides an individual mark.
   \ma : Hides all marks in the current buffer.
   \mm : Places the next available mark.

ShowMarks requires that Vim is compiled with the +signs feature.
